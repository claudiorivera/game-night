# game-night

An full-stack web application that lets you create and join board game nights.

Uses the [BoardGameGeek API2](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to pull game info, using [fast-xml-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-xml-parser) to [parse the XML](https://github.com/claudiorivera/game-night/tree/master/client/src/lib) into some custom JSON.
